# CloudTransferTask
## About CloudTransferTask 🎉
CloudTransferTask is a highly configurable C# based wrapper for **rclone**. If you want to maximize your rclone experience you came to the right place! 😉  
With this console appication you can define _tasks_ (also known as jobs) that can be used to start a rclone action with a single parameter.  
Ex. `CloudTransferTask.exe GDriveBackup`

## Requirements & Installation
### Requirements:
- **OS**: Linux, Windows, (OS X - Currently not tested)
- **rclone**: Newest Version
- **Runtime**: .NET Core 3.1
- **Additionally**: [CloudTransferTaskService](https://github.com/xRoXaSx/CloudTransferTaskService) to run CloudTransferTask automatically on file changes
- **Time to set it up** ☕

### Installation:
1. Download the latest version of rclone ([can be found here](https://rclone.org/downloads/)) and set it up
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/xRoXaSx/CloudTransferTask/releases) or clone the project
3. If you want to build the project yourself and if not already installed, install the .NET Core Runtime. If you just want to run the app use one of the corresponding releases and skip this step  
    - Windows: [.NET Core Runtime 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (For more ease "<u>.NET Core Desktop Runtime 3.1.\*</u>" **or** for minimalists "<u>.NET Core Runtime 3.1.\*</u>")
    - Linux: Use your packetmanager to download the latest .NET Core Runtime 3.1 from Microsoft's repo ([MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/core/install/linux))
    - MacOS: Use the corresponding donwload link from [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/core/install/macos#supported-releases) 
4. Move the downloaded zip into a directory where it doesn't bother you, unzip it there and start the application from that location (Another folder called `service` will be created)
    1. Open up a terminal window (sh, ksh, bash, CMD, PowerShell, ...)
    2. Start the application via command line:
        - **If downloaded from Releases**: path\to\CloudTransferTask(.exe)
        - **If built locally**: dotnet path/to/CloudTransferTask.dll
5. Open your file explorer and change into your `ApplicationData` directory: 
    - Windows: `%appdata%` (`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming`)
    - Linux: `$HOME/.config` (`/home/$USER/.config`)
    - OSX: `~/Library/Application Support` (`/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support`)
6. Find the `CloudTransferTask` folder (lower case if you're on a Unix like OS) and open the `config.json` file
7. Modify the json file to your liking
